# Bike Sales Data Analysis using SQL

This project demonstrates the process of querying and analyzing bike sales data from a `bikestores` database using SQL. The purpose of this project is to extract and visualize essential data that can later be used in Tableau for creating dashboards and simplifying the analysis.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to select and display only the necessary data from various tables within the `bikestores` database. This data will then be prepared for visualization in Tableau to create meaningful dashboards for further analysis.

## SQL Query Explanation

In this project, SQL queries are used to process and manipulate the data. The key steps include:

- **SELECT**: Used to extract the specific data needed for analysis.
- **JOIN**: This combines data from multiple tables based on a related column.
- **GROUP BY**: Used to aggregate the data, making it easier to analyze at a grouped level (e.g., by sales representative or product category).

## Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard was built in Tableau using the results from the SQL data. It provides an overview of various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to bike sales, including revenue, customer count, and sales performance across different categories. Below are the key metrics included in the dashboard:

- **Total Revenue:** Displays total revenue generated over the selected period.
- **Total Customers:** Shows the total number of unique customers.
- **Total Sales Orders:** Displays the total number of sales orders placed.
- **Total Sales Reps:** The number of active sales representatives.
- **Revenue/Month:** A line chart that tracks monthly revenue trends.
- **Revenue/Year:** A bar chart that compares revenue across different years.
- **Revenue by Category:** A breakdown of sales revenue by product category.
- **Revenue by Brand Name:** Shows the revenue contribution from each brand.
- **Revenue by State:** A map that visualizes sales across different U.S. states.
- **Revenue by Store:** A pie chart that shows revenue distribution across store locations.
- **Top 10 Customers:** A bar chart displaying the top customers based on revenue.
- **Revenue by Sales Rep:** A bar chart that displays revenue generated by each sales representative.

## How to Run This Project

1. Run the provided SQL queries on the `bikestores` database to extract the necessary data.
2. Export the query results as a CSV file.
3. Import the CSV file into Tableau.
4. Use Tableau to build a dashboard similar to the one shown above, customizing visualizations to display key metrics such as total revenue, customer count, and sales rep performance.
5. Interact with the dashboard by filtering data by year, store, or sales rep.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the powerful combination of SQL and Tableau for data analysis. SQL is used for data extraction and preparation, while Tableau enables dynamic and insightful visualization. The resulting dashboard helps stakeholders easily track and analyze bike sales performance across various dimensions such as time, product category, and sales representatives.
